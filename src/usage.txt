"Options:\n"
"   -h, --help            Display this information.\n"
"   -p, --pin-dir=DIR     Bpffs path to pin progs to. Default: /sys/fs/bpf/udpgrm\n"
"   -i, --install=CGROUP  Install bpf hooks in given cgroup. By default\n"
"                         /sys/fs/cgroup/unified and /sys/fs/cgroup are tried.\n"
"   -s, --self            Append cgroup path extracted from /proc/self/cgroup.\n"
"       --without-sendmsg Do not install sendmsg prog, if not using flow dissector.\n"
"   -t, --tubular=UDS     Path to tubular Unix domain socket. No default.\n"
"   -d, --daemon          Create bpf programs, pin them to bpffs.\n"
"   -v, --verbose         Print more stuff.\n"
"   -f, --force           Force daemon to start even if pins in /sys exist.\n"

"See README for how to use udpgrm. Generally there are three modes:\n"
" * daemon mode: run the thing, pin bpf programs and keep it running\n"
" * install: install specific cgroup into running udpgrm\n"
" * instruction: connect to running daemon and run an instruction. Available\n"
"   ones are: \"list\", \"flows\", \"metrics\", \"delete\".\n"
